# Command Line Calculator

A simple command-line calculator written in Java.  
This program allows users to input numbers and operations sequentially and evaluate parts or all of the expression interactively.

## üí° How It Works

- Input a number when prompted.
- Then input an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
- Repeat this process to build up an expression.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Commands

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` ‚Üí Adds the operation to the expression.
- `=` ‚Üí Evaluates the **last two operands and last operator**.
- `==` ‚Üí Evaluates the **entire expression** from right to left.
- `!` ‚Üí Exits the program.
